# [Data Entities](https://github.com/neorefraction/Learning-Go/Tutorial/DataEntities)

As in other programming languages, Go has several data entities such as variables, constants, and arrays. Additionally, it is essential to remember that Go is restrictive too, because it is compiled and strongly typed. This means that it won't allow us to declare unused data elements to avoid wasting memory. Consequently, each script includes some print statements to utilize these elements and avoid errors while displaying their values.
